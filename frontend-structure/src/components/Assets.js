                    Asset management, broadly defined, refers to any system that monitors
                    and maintains things of value to an entity or group. It may apply to
                     both tangible assets (such as buildings) and to intangible assets
                     (such as human capital, intellectual property, goodwill and/or financial assets). Asset management is a systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets cost-effectively.
                    
                    The term is most commonly used in the financial sector to describe people and companies who manage investments on behalf of others. Those include, for example, investment managers that manage the assets of a pension fund.
