                Event management is the application of project management to the creation 
                and development of large-scale events such as festivals, conferences, 
                ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or conventions.<br/>
                 It involves studying the brand, identifying its target audience,
                  devising the event concept, and coordinating the technical 
                  aspects before actually launching the event
                
            </div>
        );
