                    A car parking system is a mechanical device that multiplies parking
                     capacity inside a parking lot. Parking systems are generally
                      powered by electric motors or hydraulic pumps that move vehicles
                       into a storage position.<br />

                    Car parking systems may be traditional or automated. Automatic
                     multi-storey automated car park systems are less expensive per
                     parking slot, since they tend to require less building volume
                     and less ground area than a conventional facility with the same
                      capacity. In the long term, automated car parking systems are
                      likely to be more cost effective than traditional parking garages.
                       Both automated car parking systems and automated parking garage
                        systems reduce exhaust gas â€” cars do not drive around in search
                        of parking spaces.
