                    Asset management, broadly defined, refers to any system that
                     monitors and maintains things of value to an entity or group.
                      It may apply to both tangible assets (such as buildings) and
                       to intangible assets (such as human capital, intellectual
                        property, goodwill and/or financial assets). Asset management
                         is a systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining,
      upgrading, and disposing of assets cost-effectively.<br />

                    The term is most commonly used in the financial sector to describe
                     people and companies who manage investments on behalf of others.
                     Those include, for example, investment managers that manage the
  assets of a pension fund.<br />

                    Alternative views of asset management in the engineering environment
                    are: the practice of managing assets to achieve the greatest return
                     (particularly useful for productive assets such as plant and equipment),
                      and the process of monitoring and maintaining facilities systems, with
                       the objective of providing the best possible service to users in all
                        dimensions
                
            </div>
