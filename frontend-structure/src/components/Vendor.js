                    A vendor management system (VMS) is an Internet-enabled, often Web-based
                     application that acts as a mechanism for business to manage and procure
                      staffing services – temporary, and, in some cases, permanent placement
                       services – as well as outside contract or contingent labor. Typical
                        features
                     of a VMS application include order distribution, consolidated billing
                     and significant enhancements in reporting capability that outperforms
                      manual systems and processes.[1]

                    In the financial industry due to recent regulations
                    (see FRB SR13-19;[2] OCC 2013-29[3] and CFPB 2012-03[4]), vendor management
                     implies consistent risk classification and due diligence to manage third-party risk.
                      A number of institutions have re-classified or renamed their programs to Third Party
                       Risk Management (TPRM) to align with the verbiage used by the regulatory agencies.
